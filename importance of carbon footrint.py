# Carbon footprint calculator # The carbon footprint is important because it helps us understand the impact of human activities on the environment and how to reduce it: # Climate change # The carbon footprint is a measure of the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by human activities, which contribute to climate change. # The United Nations warns that these emissions speed up climate change and can lead to a more inhospitable world. # Reducing emissions # Measuring your carbon footprint can help you identify opportunities to reduce your emissions, such as by using less energy or transportation. # Ecological footprint # The carbon footprint is a component of the Ecological Footprint, which shows how carbon emissions compare to other human demands on the planet. # Brand reputation # Businesses can enhance their brand image by publicly disclosing their carbon footprint and showing that they are aligned with sustainability. # Benchmarking # Companies can use their carbon footprint to compare their performance against competitors and set targets to reduce emissions. # Some ways to reduce your carbon footprint include: # Reducing transportation emissions by telecommuting, using fuel-efficient vehicles, or optimizing transportation routes # Reducing waste by recycling, composting, and using reusable products # Changing procurement practices to use recycled or low carbon-intensity materials # Purchasing carbon offsets or investing in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions
